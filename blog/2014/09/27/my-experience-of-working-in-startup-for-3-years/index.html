	<div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s almost three years since I&#8217;m working for <a href="http://granify.com">Granify</a> and this was the best career decision I ever made. Below is my personal experience.</p>

<h2>Startup founders do the hardest work, and you can learn a lot from them</h2>

<p>I was lucky enough not to work for large companies, but only at Granify I had a chance to feel how it really looks like to be the founder of &#8220;living&#8221; startup. When you see happy founders receiving large VC rounds, always on hype, you may think &#8220;oh, wish I was there&#8221;. But real life happens on backstages, its a long, long way, and you hardly like it. Constant tension, always on the phone, looking for money, personal responsibility for all failures, you need to really believe in what you do to not go crazy.</p>

<p>I always have few active side projects, and believe that its good practice for all engineers. Few times I tried to convert them to full-time business, but failed. And after watching to our perfect CEO Jeff Lawrence i understood why: you need to have tremendous vision and passion to withstand all the weight and responsibility, and i still need to learn a lot from him, before i can start something own.</p>

<h2>It&#8217;s not about succeeding, its about failing and not dying.</h2>

<p>There are bad and good times. If you not in top 1% of lucky startups, it mostly bad times. And the only thing startup need to do is not to die. Sometimes it takes years of failing to build the successful business, and you need to be ready for that. Do not wait for immediate outcome, and do not despair if you fail: learn from it and move on.</p>

<h2>Trust and responsibility</h2>

<p>Vision and idea are nothing without a good team. It takes time to build it, years, and for sure it is the most challenging startup goal. It&#8217;s about building trust and showing team members that without them firm is nothing. CEO role is to be transparent about all business metrics and goals, you all must be on the same page. When people feel that their decisions and opinions influence business, they starting to take work personally and feel responsible for firm future. It helps to survive failures and build strong relationships.</p>

<h2>Best learning experience</h2>

<p>At early-stage startups no one have roles, you do all the work which you can handle. Whole atmosphere of a startup is moving you out of you comfort zone and enforces to learn new things that you would never do in ordinary work. During last 3 years i learned how to work in distributed team (and help to build it), talk with people, think in terms of business value and do things that <a href="http://leonsbox.com/blog/2012/12/01/your-code-sucks/">do not scale</a>, independence, manage dozens of servers and services, create efficient architectures, delegate tasks, learn quadrillions of new technologies, and much much more.</p>

<h2>Thank you note</h2>

<p>I want personally thank Jeff Lawrence and the rest of our <a href="http://granify.com/about/">Team</a> for all the hard work and for the experience we are going through together.</p>

<p>And we are <a href="http://granify.com/contact/">hiring</a>.</p>
